# Covid_Seasonality

This repository contains a small analysis of open source Covid-19 case data from John Hopkins University. Over a 3 year period, using R, we analyze the seasonality of reported cases. We look at total cases for each season and visualize this trend by location on a map of the continental United States. Lastly, we run a Moran I test to examine the positive autocorrelation, implying that if a city has a lot of cases, nearby locations will also have large case counts for that season.
